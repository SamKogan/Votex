		Corporations are owned by people like you.  Whether you invest directly or through an investment fund or a pension scheme, you should have a say in how corporations are governed. After all, corporations are supposed to be democracies – owners even get to vote on the board of directors who can hire and fire management.<br>
		When is the last time you voted?<br>
		If you answered ‘never’, there is a good reason for that.  If you invest directly, voting is a hassle.  If you invest indirectly, the intermediary won’t listen to your wishes.  And in either case, making an informed voting decision is very difficult.<br>
		Votex changes all this.  We make voting choices simple, the voting process straightforward, and we work with financial intermediaries to pass through your votes.<br>
		We don’t tell you how to vote – it’s up to you.  You choose whether to support an existing group of activists, to establish your own, or to decide on a case-by-case basis. <br>
		We just want you to vote.  And when you join together with like-minded people, your vote gives you power.  Very real power to influence companies all around you.  <br>
		Act like you own the world.<br>
		Because you do.<br>
